Configuration
The CircleCI configuration file (.circleci/config.yml) in this repository specifies the jobs and workflows to be executed on each commit pushed to the main branch. It includes the following steps:

Add your React code
Install dependencies
Run tests

Usage
Create a CircleCI account (if you don't have one already) and link your GitHub repository to CircleCI.

Once the repository is linked, any commit pushed to the main branch will trigger a CircleCI build automatically.

CircleCI will run the defined jobs and workflows specified in the configuration file.

If the tests fail, the build will fail, and you will be notified.
